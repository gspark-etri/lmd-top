`lmd-top` correlates the four layers of an llm-d serving stack — Gateway → EPP (Endpoint
Picker) → model server → infrastructure — across heterogeneous accelerators (NVIDIA GPU,
Rebellions RBLN, Furiosa RNGD, and host CPU). It reads your existing Prometheus and
Kubernetes; it stores no data of its own.

## Demo

![lmd-top demo](docs/demo.gif)

<sub>Soft (Catppuccin) theme, live braille timelines, and cross-layer drill-down. Regenerate with `lmd-top --cast && agg docs/demo.cast docs/demo.gif`.</sub>

## Highlights

- **Four layers on one screen.** The Gateway, EPP/InferencePool, model servers, and hardware are correlated, so you can answer *which model runs where, how requests are routed, and how load is distributed* without switching tools.
- **Heterogeneous accelerators, unified.** NVIDIA GPU, Rebellions RBLN, and Furiosa RNGD sit side by side. The exact GPU model and its VRAM are auto-detected, unified-memory parts (GB10, GH200) are recognized and marked `∪`, and per-node disk usage is tracked too.
- **EPP-aware.** It reads the EPP `ConfigMap` (active scorers, weights, and picker), visualizes routing decisions and per-pod queues, and diagnoses whether an HTTPRoute actually flows through the InferencePool or bypasses it.
- **Deployment lifecycle.** The Deploy view groups each model's compiled variants (tensor/pipeline parallelism, quantization, RBLN/Furiosa NPU options), shows which node and disk they live on, and highlights where there is free capacity to place them.
- **A rich terminal UI.** An LED device grid, a stacked VRAM bar, braille timelines, active alerting, log tailing, and a `scale` action — with four themes and understated animations, all in a single static Rust binary that has no C dependencies.

## Views

Switch views with the number keys `0`–`7`, or cycle with `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`.

| # | View | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Overview** | Cluster summary, LED device grid, VRAM bar, accelerators by kind/node, EPP path, models, and a one-line diagnosis |
| 1 | **Nodes** hub | Node health (CPU/mem/disk/load + devices). Press `w` to cycle the hub: **nodes → devices** (per-device util/VRAM/temp/power) **→ serving** (per-model p95 latency QUEUE→PREFILL→DECODE→TPOT→E2E, tok/s, + SLO advisor) **→ map** (Canvas topology: Gateway→EPP→Pool flow + device pressure heatmap) |
| 2 | **Models** | Per-model accelerator/node, ready, running/waiting, KV%, tok/s, route, status. `⏎` opens the action menu (Info/Compile/Deploy/Stop/Scale/Restart/Logs/YAML/Objective) |
| 3 | **EPP** | Scorers and weights, the picker, InferencePool endpoints, and request distribution |
| 4 | **Flow** | Gateway → HTTPRoute → backend → pods, with InferencePool/EPP/SLO and the EPP-bypass diagnosis; `⏎` jumps to the backend model |
| 5 | **Pods** | `llm-serving` pods (ready / phase / node / restarts); `⏎` actions (Info/Logs/YAML/Delete) |
| 6 | **Deploy** | Model lifecycle: compiled variants (family → build, options, `@node /path`), device occupancy per node, and catalog feasibility. `⏎` acts on the selection (Compile→RBLN/Furiosa · Deploy · node Cordon · …) |
| 7 | **Events** | Kubernetes + llm-d events, newest first; `⏎` shows the full message |

List headers show a `Σ` aggregate of the shown rows (all rows, or just the filtered ones). `y` shows any selected resource's live YAML (read-only).

## Install

**Prebuilt binary** (Linux x86_64):

```bash
VER=v0.32.0   # latest: https://github.com/gspark-etri/lmd-top/releases/latest
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/gspark-etri/lmd-top/releases/download/$VER/lmd-top-$VER-x86_64-linux.tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo install -m 0755 lmd-top /usr/local/bin/
```

A `.sha256` checksum is published alongside each release asset.

**From source** (needs a Rust toolchain and a C linker, `cc`/`gcc` — nothing else):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gspark-etri/lmd-top.git && cd lmd-top
./install.sh                 # installs any missing prereqs, then runs `cargo install`
#   ./install.sh --check     # report what's present/missing, install nothing
#   ./install.sh --with-demo # also install agg and regenerate the demo GIF
# by hand: cargo install --path .
```

**Runtime requirements:**

- `kubectl` with kubeconfig access, and network reachability to Prometheus. It never SSHes into accelerator nodes.
- A truecolor terminal with a font covering box-drawing and braille glyphs is recommended; otherwise run with `LMD_THEME=default`.
- The binary links only glibc — no OpenSSL, pkg-config, or cmake. `xdg-open` is optional (used only by the `g` key).

## Usage

```bash
lmd-top                      # launch the TUI (permission mode: observe)
lmd-top --mode admin         # allow operational actions (scale / restart / apply)
lmd-top --json               # print machine-readable agent state (JSON)
lmd-top --doctor             # survey Prometheus: exporters, metric coverage, gaps
lmd-top --audit              # print the audit log of applied mutations
lmd-top --snapshot | --render | --cast   # headless text / CI render / demo asciicast
LMD_PROM=10.0.0.5:30090 LMD_NS=my-ns lmd-top   # point at another cluster
```

**Permission modes** (`--mode`, shown as a header badge) gate actions:
`observe` (default, view only) → `debug` (adds logs, `l`) → `admin` (scale, restart, stop,
compile/deploy apply, cordon, route rename/retarget) → `danger` (delete pod/job/route rule).
Mutating actions open a confirmation popup that defaults to **No**.
Every applied mutation (scale, stop, restart, cordon, delete, route edit, apply) is appended
to an **audit log** (`~/.config/lmd-top/audit.log`, or `$LMD_AUDIT`) with timestamp, mode,
action, target, and result — view it with `lmd-top --audit`.

**Keys.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Navigate | `↑↓`/`kj` select · `⏎` action menu (or drill) · `w` Nodes-hub / panel focus · `←→` step · `p i r e m` cross-layer pivot |
| Act | `/` filter · `:` command palette (fuzzy-jump to any view/display action) · `o`/`O` column sort (cycle column / toggle ▲▼) · `y` live YAML · `l` logs · action menu → Compile/Deploy/Scale/Restart/Stop/Delete/Cordon/Objective (mode-gated, default-No confirm) |
| Display | `t` theme · `f` animations · `z` zoom · `Space` pause · `g` Grafana · `A` alerts · `?` help · `q` quit |

**Environment.**

- `LMD_PROM`, `LMD_NS` (default `llm-serving`), `LMD_GRAFANA` — point it at your cluster.
- `LMD_THEME` — startup theme: `soft`, `default`, `high-contrast`, or `colorblind`.
- `LMD_AUDIT` — audit log path (default: `~/.config/lmd-top/audit.log`).
- `LMD_W` / `LMD_H` — the `--render` size.
- `LMD_COMPILE_IMAGE_RBLN`, `LMD_COMPILE_IMAGE_FURIOSA`, `LMD_SERVING_IMAGE` — container images for the generated compile/deploy manifests. Until set, those fields are `TODO-…` placeholders and the in-app apply (`a`) is blocked; `w` still saves the manifest to edit by hand.
- `LMD_SAVE_DIR` — where `w` writes saved manifests (default: current dir).
- Optional `~/.config/lmd-top/lmd-top.yaml` customizes column order.

**Colors and glyphs.** Color encodes severity or identity, while state is carried by a
separate glyph (`●` up, `○` idle, `◐` pending, `⚠` throttling, `⊘` cordoned, `✗` down) so the
UI stays legible in the colorblind theme. Metrics that aren't present yet render as `–` and
fill in once the workload is up.

## Data path

lmd-top reads your existing stack and correlates it; it owns no data.

| Layer | Source | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Accelerators / host | Prometheus | `DCGM_FI_DEV_*`, `RBLN_DEVICE_STATUS:*`, `furiosa_npu_*`, `node_*` |
| Model server | Prometheus | `vllm:*_latency_seconds_bucket`, `vllm:num_requests_*`, `vllm:*kv_cache*` |
| EPP / Pool | Prometheus + ConfigMap | `inference_pool_*`, `inference_extension_*`, `llmd-router-epp` cm |
| Topology / status / actions | `kubectl` | Deployment, Pod, HTTPRoute, Gateway, InferencePool, InferenceObjective |

Data arrives on two tiers: a fast tier (~1 s) for accelerators and nodes, and a full
snapshot (~3 s) for everything else. It's pure Rust — Prometheus is queried over raw `tokio`
HTTP/1.0, and Kubernetes through `kubectl`.

## Status & roadmap

**Works today, with no traffic required.** All ten views; GPU/RBLN/RNGD and node/disk
monitoring with auto-detection and unified memory; the Flow topology and EPP-bypass
diagnosis; EPP ConfigMap introspection; active alerting; the `scale` and `logs` actions; the
Deploy view (compiled variants, storage node, deploy targets); the headless `--json`,
`--doctor`, `--snapshot`, and `--cast` modes; and themes, animation, zoom, and permission modes.

**Fills in once real traffic flows through the EPP and vLLM exposes metrics.** Per-model p95
latency breakdown, tok/s, per-pod queue distribution, KV%/TTFT/E2E, and EPP request
distribution. (The EPP weight `+`/`-` is a local weight-share simulation — it does not apply
to the cluster.)

**Planned.** Applied control-plane actions (endpoint drain, traffic/policy-weight apply, and
rollout, each as dry-run → confirm → audit); an EPP per-endpoint score debugger; and **NPU
compile & deploy automation** — from the Deploy view, compile a model for RBLN or Furiosa (as
a Kubernetes Job running the vendor toolchain) and deploy the artifact through ModelService,
gated by permission mode. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Maturity

Verified against a live heterogeneous cluster (8 nodes; GB10, RBLN, and RNGD accelerators;
EPP, routes, and models live). It's experimental (0.x), so interfaces may still change.
